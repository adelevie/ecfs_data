The Leadership Conference is a coalition charged by its \ndiverse membership of more than 200 national organizations to promote and protect the \nrights of all persons in the United States.  We are grateful for your strong leadership in \nensuring affordable, equitable, and accountable communications everywhere, and commend \nyour efforts to advance the opportunity for affordable broadband in rural America, ensure \nreasonably priced calls to the incarcerated, and increase participation by women and people \nof color in media, among other major initiatives. \n \nIn summary, we recommend the following actions:  \n \n\n• Retention of existing media ownership limits and institution of the minority tax \ncredit; \n\n• Rapid and effective implementation of the recent Lifeline modernization; \n• Defense of the Commission’s prison phone caps to protect families and increase \n\ncommunity safety by reducing recidivism; \n• Ample access to unlicensed spectrum, particularly for entrepreneurs with limited \n\naccess to capital; \n• Prohibition of forced arbitration and adoption of policies to prevent bill shock; \n• A strong FCC Office of Native Affairs; and  \n• Policies to promote disability access to all telecommunications, particularly for \n\nemergency communications. \n \n\nCompetitive and Representative Media \n \nMedia diversity has long been a top priority of The Leadership Conference and our members \nbecause we understand that meaningful protection of civil rights and advancement of key \npolicy objectives rely in great measure on an accurate, independent, and diverse media that \nserves our constituencies.  As we commented in the independent programming docket, \n\n\n\n  \n \nJanuary 11, 2017 \nPage 2 of 4 \n\n  \n\n“people of color and women are vastly underrepresented in the cable and broadcast programming today—\nnot only in front of and behind the camera, but also as owners of entertainment companies.”1  The \nstatistics we filed at that time amply demonstrated an entertainment industry where women, people of \ncolor, people with disabilities, and the LGBTQ community are all pushed to the margins. \n \nWe remain concerned that minority and female ownership of broadcast outlets continues to be dismal. \nWho owns the media matters, as there is a direct connection between those who own broadcast stations \nand the content they transmit, and studies demonstrate owners of color are more likely to offer content \nthat serves underserved audiences.2  A fully dynamic and competitive market will also produce more jobs \nand help to increase the diversity of voices available to all audiences.   \n \nAs a first order of business, the Commission in 2017 should do no harm. The current local media \nownership rules offer a First Amendment-friendly neutral bulwark against media consolidation.  With the \nproliferation of online so-called “fake news,” competitive independent local news and media outlets \nbecome even more important.  The Commission should quickly reject requests to reconsider last August's \nvote on the Quadrennial Ownership Review.3 \n \nIn order to improve ownership diversity, we could not agree more strongly that the years-long bipartisan \nand industry consensus in support of reinstatement of the minority tax certificate program should bear \nfruit this year.  The Commission should take the lead in developing the record necessary to support the \nreestablishment of this program.  Such an effort would be more effective than other proposals. \n \nLifeline \n \nWe believe Commission policies must ensure that all members of society are connected to modern, \nadvanced communications networks and services and fully support last year’s Commission decision to \nmodernize Lifeline so that it supports the cost of broadband services for low-income households.  The \nreforms adopted as part of the modernization put the program on firm footing, and we look forward to \ncollaborating with the FCC and USAC as they work to rapidly, but carefully, implement the new reforms.  \nDuring 2017 we will begin to see the implementation of your proposals to take carriers out of the \neligibility determination process.  During this time the Leadership Conference, its members, and the many \nsupporters of Lifeline modernization will actively work to educate the public about this program.  \nThrough volunteer efforts and collaboration with the various federal, state and local entities, we support \nbringing information about Lifeline to all eligible households, including those that are eligible and \nreceiving information for other state and federal benefits programs. \n \nPrison Communications \n \nNot only is access to communication a human right, but communications with supportive friends, clergy \nand family members for people in jail or prison is a critical component of a successful return to society \nand safer communities.  Recidivism costs the public dearly at federal, state, and local levels.     \n \n\n\n\n  \n \nJanuary 11, 2017 \nPage 3 of 4 \n\n  \n\nThus, like the Commissioner, we support Rep. Bobby Rush's Family Telephone Connection Protection \nAct and Sen. Tammy Duckworth's Video Visitation in Prisons Act.  Similarly, we urge states and \nlocalities around the country to initiate or continue their efforts at the local level to bring down calling \nrates in prisons, jails and other confining institutions. \n \nDespite the Commission's noble efforts over the last few years, we have not yet seen the full benefit of \nreasonable regulation due to attacks by prison phone companies and localities that profit off families in \nexigent circumstances.  These court challenges have limited the impact of the Commission's efforts, \nleaving families and clergy vulnerable.  Defense of existing rules has long been a hallmark of sound \ngovernance and we strongly hope and expect that the Commission will continue to pursue and defend its \ncurrent rules against attack.  \n \nUnlicensed Spectrum \n \nBecause of unlicensed spectrum’s low barriers to entry, it is an important resource for entrepreneurs, \nincluding many communities of color and women, who have a hard time accessing capital. The \nLeadership Conference has been a supporter of innovative uses of unlicensed spectrum, including to \nenhance broadband access for all. \n \nConsumer Protection \n \nForced arbitration clauses, frequently buried in the fine print of telecommunications contracts, deprive \nconsumers of their ability to vindicate their rights in court. Instead consumers are forced to resolve any \ndisputes that they may have with the company in a private and secret forum in which the company is a \nrepeat player with an inherent advantage.  Based on a comprehensive review of this landscape several \nagencies, including the Department of Education, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the \nDepartment of Labor, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have proposed important reforms \nthat would restore individuals' ability to vindicate the rights given to them under the law.4  We encourage \nthe Commission to do the same and stand up for ordinary working-people so they may receive the full \nprotection of the law when they do not receive the services they were promised.  Likewise, for the same \nreasons that our members support the efforts of the FCC and wireless carriers to stop bill shock, we \nbelieve consumers, particularly low-income consumers, should receive clear and simple notification, \nbefore sign-up, of all the costs (including taxes and fees) they will face when subscribing to a \ncommunications service. \n \nDisability and Tribal Affairs \n \nWe support the Commissioner's proposal to empower the FCC's Office of Native Affairs as a standalone \nOffice with its own budget that is sufficient to proactively engage with Tribes on important issues of \ncommunications policy.  We further support continuation of Mr. Wheeler's leadership in ensuring \ntelecommunications access for people with disabilities, including texting solutions and improved access \nto emergency alerts.  \n \n\n\n\n  \n \nJanuary 11, 2017 \nPage 4 of 4 \n\n  \n\nWe strongly welcome and endorse your efforts and the work of your staff on behalf of ordinary people \neverywhere, and to enhanced, in your words, “community, community, community.”  Thank you for this \nopportunity to offer feedback on the Solutions 2020 Action Plan.

In addition, despite Securus’ previously repeated claims that ICSolutions was \nin violation of law because ICSolutions continued to honor its customer contracts which included \n\nthe sharing of profits on Interstate calling, Securus’ offer to Georgia DOC included the payment \nof commissions on Interstate calling.   \n\n \n\nIt has recently come to our attention that Global Tel*Link (GTL) has submitted a financial offer \n\nfor $0.0125 per minute for all calls, domestic and international, prepaid, debit, and collect – \nwhich is significantly below the rates in any of the FCC’s Rate Orders and inconsistent with the \nclaims that the FCC’s rates do not allow the providers to recover costs.  The financial offer, \nwhich was submitted to the Nebraska DOC on June 17, 2016, is shown on Page 2 of the Pricing \n\nSummary, as well as in the Cost Proposal (Pages 15 to 16) , both of which are included in \n\nAttachment 1 to this filing.  In addition, Pages 2 to 13 of the Pricing Summary has tables of the \n\ncalling features and services included with the financial offer of $0.0125 per minute, which \n\nappears to include all the necessary functions for providing safe, secure, and reliable inmate \n\ntelephone services. Based upon GTL’s offer, the Nebraska DOC awarded the contract to GTL. \n \n\nRespectfully, \n\n \nTim McAteer, President \n\n \n\nCc: Chairman Tom Wheeler \n\nCommissioner Mignon Clyburn \n\nCommissioner Jessica Rosenworcel \n\nCommissioner Ajit Pai \n\nCommissioner Michael O’Rielly \nMatthew DelNero, Bureau Chief \n\n \n\nStephanie Weiner, Legal Advisor to Chairman Wheeler \n\nClaude Aiken, Legal Advisor to Comm’r Clyburn \nTravis Litman, Legal Advisor to Comm’r Rosenworcel \nNicholas Degani, Legal Advisor to Comm’r Pai \nAmy Bender, Legal Advisor to Comm’r O’Rielly \nMadeleine V.

Moreover, Truthout provides a platform for transformative ideas and critical analysis in combatting those injustices. HEARD wants to ensure that the Commission and all interested parties are apprised of this pioneering investigative series on Phone Justice for DDBDDHH incarcerated people. As such, we have included part one of the series as an attachment to this filing. \n\nWe trust that this series will further illustrate what HEARD, by and through prisoners, family members, advocates and attorneys, have long-since expressed to this Commission.

Qualified\nprisoners can earn a certificate in ASL interpreting, which could potentially lead to job opportunities if\nthey are released. Louisiana also uses these \"offender interpreters\" to interpret for the deaf population\nin its vast prison system.\n\nWilliam Johanson trains a dog in the yard at Rayburn Correctional Center in Angie, Louisiana. After\nreceiving complaints from another prisoner in the mid­1990s, federal officials sued the Louisiana\nstate prison system on behalf of Johanson to bring facilities with deaf prisoners into compliance with\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act. (Photo: Annie Flanagan)\n\nLouisiana has the highest incarceration rate of any state in the US, and the US has the highest\nincarceration rate of any country on the planet. That's why Louisiana is known as the \"prison capital of\nthe world.\" The operation is not cheap. \"We're broke,\" Griffin says flatly.\n\nLouisiana is known for supporting its prison system with prison labor, and the ASL program is no\ndifferent. Paying professional interpreters from the outside to interpret for deaf prisoners would cost\nhundreds of thousands of dollars a year. For Griffin the program is a win-win innovation that provides\njob training while saving taxpayer dollars. It also helped the prison system get out of hot water with the\nfeds.\n\n\"We had to fight for it,\" Griffin says of the program. \"The\nJustice Department sued [us] and said we were not in\ncompliance.\" She was referring to compliance with the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the federal law that\n\n\n\nof ASL interpreters in the\ncriminal legal system.\n\nrequires public facilities such as schools, jail and prisons to\naccommodate people with disabilities and provide equal\naccess to programs and services.\n\nThe Justice Department launched a probe into Louisiana's prisons in the mid-1990s after receiving\ncomplaints from a fellow prisoner on behalf of William Johanson, a deaf man serving a life sentence.\nOfficials sued the prison system to increase basic accessibility measures for Johanson, from\ninterpreters to fire alarms that flash bright lights. Officials originally wanted Louisiana prisons to hire\nprofessional interpreters to be on call for prisoners like Johanson, not \"offender interpreters\" who work\nfor little or no pay.\n\nStudents practice American Sign Language during a class at a prison near Baton Rouge. Some go on\nto interpret for deaf prisoners, a practice that advocates say is problematic, but better than nothing.\n(Photo: Annie Flanagan)\n\nDeaf advocates agree, arguing that allowing prisoners to do very low or unpaid labor interpreting for\nother prisoners could lead to the exploitation or coercion of some of the most vulnerable in the\npopulation. Advocates are excited that prisoners are learning ASL -- the more people who can speak the\nlanguage, the better -- but they argue that the ADA requires neutral, professional interpreters divorced\nfrom the politics of prison life on duty at jails and prisons, not to mention police stations, and parole\nand probation offices.\n\nStill, Griffin was able to negotiate the program into a legal settlement with federal officials, and since\nthen, the number of disciplinary actions against deaf prisoners have dropped dramatically. Students\nalso report success. \"This program is meaningful to the population, and we got to help each other,\" says\nJerry Wade, a graduate of the program who interprets for fellow prisoners. Wade's father, who has\nsince passed away, was deaf, and Wade says he would never forget how proud his father was when he\nvisited the prison on graduation day. \"That was the first time I could communicate with him clearly\nusing his language.\"\n\n\n\n\"Everyone involved in the\nsystem is lacking\ncompetency in deaf\nculture and deaf\ncommunication,\" Lewis\nsays.\n\nLouisiana's interpreter program is an outlier. From the squad\ncar to the prison cell, advocates say there is a severe shortage\nof ASL interpreters in the criminal legal system. Deaf people\nare often denied access to interpreters in court, and lack\noptions for contacting lawyers, doctors, friends and family\nonce in custody. Police and prison guards often\nmisunderstand people who are deaf and hard of hearing,\nleading to unjust arrests, false confessions and physical abuse.\nParole and probation offices often fail to provide interpreters\nfor the deaf, who can be coerced into signing legal documents and statements that they don't\nunderstand. The result is the warehousing of deaf people in jails and prisons where the inability to\ncommunicate makes it difficult to survive, much less find a way back to the free world.\n\n \"I think it's important to note that everyone is behind. There is not one prison system that I would say\ngets it completely right,\" says TL Lewis, the director of the deaf advocacy group Helping Educate to\nAdvance the Rights of the Deaf (HEARD). \"With 2-plus million people behind bars -- the majority of\nwhom being people with disabilities -- there's no excuse and no room for not getting this right.  It's the\ndefinition of a crisis.\"\n\nA teletypewriter, or TTY machine, in a storage closet at Rayburn Correctional Center. Deaf prisoners\nsay the devices are difficult and costly to use, leaving them isolated from friends, family and legal\nrepresentatives. (Photo: Annie Flanagan)\n\nThe deaf community includes people who identify as deaf, hard of hearing, deaf-blind, as well as deaf\npeople with other disabilities and children of deaf adults. This community has its own distinct culture,\nbut few in the criminal legal system know much about it, according to Lewis. For example, deaf people\noften touch others on the shoulder to get their attention. \"Touch a cop like that and see what happens,\"\nLewis says.\n\n\n\nSome deaf and hard of hearing people are not considered culturally deaf; perhaps their parents pushed\nlip reading and hearing implants instead of ASL. Still, spoken language is not an efficient form of\ncommunication, but how does a deaf person who can't speak well express this to busy cop or an angry\nprison guard? The same problems exist in mainstream schools, where deaf students are chronically\nunderserved, leading to educational and developmental delays, according to Lewis. Without a basic\nunderstanding of the deaf experience, police, school principals, judges, prosecutors and defense\nattorneys can all be complicit in funneling deaf people into prisons, where they are at risk of physical\nand sexual abuse. \"Everyone involved in the system is lacking competency in deaf culture and deaf\ncommunication,\" Lewis says.\n\nAcross the country, civil rights attorneys are suing jail and prisons on behalf of the deaf imprisoned\ncommunity in order to force compliance with federal disability laws, but stubborn prison bosses will\noften fight long court battles before improving conditions. Last year, an HIV-positive deaf man in\nWashington, DC, won a civil lawsuit (http://aclu-nca.org/news/victory-district-violated-deaf-\nprisoners-rights-federal-court-rules) against local jailers and their private contactors who held him\nwithout an interpreter or adequate telecommunication services for 51 days, during which time he was\nunable to effectively communicate with a doctor about much-needed medication. Prison bosses in\nKentucky and Maryland (http://www.washlaw.org/news-a-media/423-deaf-inmates-md-ky-\nsettlement) recently agreed to settlements requiring qualified interpreters and videophones, and\nsimilar lawsuits have been filed in other states where advocates exhausted other options.\n\nIt's a piecemeal path to reform, but Lewis says reform is desperately needed. The criminal legal system\nis difficult for hearing people to navigate, but for deaf people it can be a complete nightmare. From\ntheir first interaction with the police to incarceration, deaf people can fall through the cracks into a\nworld of silent isolation -- a prison inside a prison.\n\nFighting for the Right to Call Home\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why do the authorities\nfeel like they don't have to\nfollow the law?\"\n\nEmmanuel Steward signs during an interview at Rayburn Correctional Center. (Photo: Annie\nFlanagan)\n\nScott Huffman was one of the first graduates of Griffin's ASL program. When I first met Huffman at a\nNew Orleans coffee shop in late 2015, he was working to convince a large jail in a neighboring suburb to\ninstall video relay screens for a deaf man being held there. Video relay screens, or VRS, allow deaf\npeople to make video calls to remote interpreters who translate their conversation from sign language\nto English for the receiver on the other end. For many in the deaf community, VRS is a part of everyday\nlife, just like a landline telephone, but the service is not available at the Jefferson Parish Prison and\nmost jails across the country.\n\nThe federal government reimburses VRS companies for calls\nmade on their systems with funds collected from a universal\ntax on phone bills, so the service is essentially free. These\ncompanies also offer the VRS equipment to jails and prisons\nfor free, so installing them sounds like a no-brainer. Even the\n\nnotorious Orleans Parish Prison in New Orleans, which has been fending off a federal takeover due to\nviolence and poor conditions, recently installed VRS. When I met back up with Huffman in June 2016,\nhowever, he still had not made any progress in neighboring Jefferson Parish.\n\n\"They did diddlysquat,\" Huffman told me as we sat down at another coffee shop. \"Why do the\nauthorities feel like they don't have to follow the law?\"\n\nJefferson Parish Prison caught Huffman's attention because a young deaf man named Nelson Arce was\nbeing held there. Arce, who has struggled with opioid dependence, traveled to a drug treatment center\nfor deaf patients in California after being charged with drug possession. Crossing state lines turned out\nto be a probation violation, and Arce was sent back to Louisiana mid-treatment. In an interview, Arce's\nfather said that the probation office refused to provide interpreters, and officers tried to communicate\nby writing notes and reading lips, so miscommunication was inevitable. Instead of receiving the\ntreatment he so badly needed, Arce ended up back in jail, without VRS to call home.\n\nAs an on-the-ground activist with HEARD, Huffman hears stories like this all the time. He tries to work\nwith jails and probation offices to make them more accessible to the deaf and hard of hearing, but when\nadvocacy and education fail, lawsuits often follow. Just last week, attorneys filed a class-action lawsuit\nagainst Louisiana's state parole and probation office on behalf of three deaf parolees, alleging that they\nhave been consistently denied access to interpreters and other aides at required classes and meetings.\n\nHuffman became an advocate while serving a five-year sentence in a Louisiana prison where about 10\ndeaf prisoners were held. He became fascinated with ASL after watching the deaf men talk to each\nother, so he asked his mother to mail him a sign language dictionary and began studying. When he felt\nconfident, he approached the deaf men to try out his new skills and soon became immersed in the\nlanguage. The warden eventually asked Huffman to move into the unit where the deaf men lived, and\nhe became their de facto interpreter, learning first-hand about the challenges they faced everyday.\n\n\"Not only do we lead the world in incarceration, we have a unjust system, especially for these deaf,\ndeaf-blind, deaf-disabled, hard of hearing prisoners,\" Huffman says. \"They live in a prison within a\nprison, so not only are they incarcerated, but now they're extra incarcerated because they don't have\ncommunication.\"\n\n\n\nHuffman says guards are known to rough up deaf and hard of hearing prisoners for ignoring verbal\norders, and the deaf prisoners have trouble accessing services like education, health care and addiction\ntreatment. Deaf prisoners are also unable access the 24-hour rape hotlines that are available to hearing\nprisoners, and it can be impossible to report abuse and seek help from medical staff and counselors\nwithout the help of an interpreter. Prisons are isolating places that spur violence and harm, including\nviolence perpetrated by authority figures: Research shows (http://www.allgov.com/news/top-\nstories/half-of-sexual-assaults-in-jail-and-prison-committed-by-guards-and-most-by-female-staff-\n140125?news=852260) that guards commit about half of all sexual assaults.\n\nMembers of the Steward family put a cell phone on speaker and gather around to talk to Emmanuel\nSteward, who is calling through a video relay service from prison. The Stewards say the video relay\nhas made it much easier to stay in touch, but they want Emmanuel moved to a prison closer to their\nhome in southern Louisiana so they can make more in­person visits. (Photo: Annie Flanagan)\n\nHuffman says he saw a lot of \"terrible things\" happen to deaf prisoners and, acting as a hearing ally,\ntried to prevent as much as he could. \"Deaf people are easy targets, so a lot of sexual abuse happens,\nmost often,\" he says, explaining how a deaf prisoner's inability to pick up on cues in the shower or\nbathroom could lead to unwanted advances and even assault. \"So, prison culture and deaf culture are\ntwo different worlds. And so deaf people don't have the opportunity to auditorily learn the things that\nyou need to learn about prison culture when you get there.\"\n\nAt the time, Rayburn Correctional Center did not have VRS. As in the vast majority of jails in prisons on\nthe US, the closest thing to a telephone that Huffman's deaf pals could use was a teletypewriter, or TTY,\nwhich sends text messages typed on a keyboard over traditional telephone landlines. On the outside,\ncell phones and VRS have largely replaced TTY in the deaf community, which considers TTY to be as\nobsolete as pagers and pay phones.\n\n\"I was the VRS, I was the videophone,\" Huffman says. \"I would use my family's money, and … contact\n[the deaf prisoners'] families, and I would interpret the phone conversations and all that.\"\n\n\n\n\nThis wasn't just inefficient; it was costly. Private companies that provide phone services at prisons have\nlong been accused of price gouging. In fact, per-minute rates have gotten so out of control that the\nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) is currently fighting a major legal battle to cap them,\nmarking a major victory for civil rights advocates. Using TTY is even worse. Until a recent FCC\nintervention, prison phone companies charged same per-minute rate for TTY calls as landline phone\ncalls, even though TTY calls can take much longer to complete, especially for those who primarily speak\nASL. Families of deaf prisoners have sent copies of phone bills for hundreds of dollars to HEARD's\noffice, and many in the deaf community no longer use TTY to begin with.\n\nASL and English have different rules for structure and syntax, so rough ASL-to-English translations\nover a TTY machine can easily become garbled. Facial expressions and body language are essential\nparts of an ASL conversation, but there is no room for physical communication in a text message. Plus,\nmost lawyers don't use TTY, and advocates complain that, citing security concerns, some prisons block\ncalls to government-funded relay services that read TTY messages out loud for hearing people on the\nother end. Many -- but certainly not all -- deaf people use ASL, not English, as their primary language,\nand translating specialized vocabulary about medical issues, legal cases over TTY can be a time-\nconsuming challenge.\n\nAfter his release in 2013, Huffman and HEARD worked with Griffin to install VRS at Rayburn\nCorrection Center and other state facilities with deaf prisoners, making Louisiana one of the few states\nto offer the service. Earlier this year, I visited Rayburn with a multimedia team to watch Emmanuel\nSteward and William Johanson, the two remaining prisoners from Huffman's original circle, make calls\non the VRS. As other prisoners looked on from inside a large caged room, the men took turns sitting\ndown in front a cabinet in a hallway that holds the video screen. They dialed a number on a keyboard\nand interpreters appeared on the screen, ready to relay their words to family members back home.\n\nSpeaking through interpreters in the prison's white-walled conference room, both Steward and\nJohanson told us that the VRS was a game-changer. Johanson, who was incarcerated with little formal\neducation, says using TTY was often \"puzzling\" and lawyers didn't even have the machines in their\noffices. He eventually gave up, opting to write letters instead.\n\n\"I couldn't understand the stuff they'd mean,\" Johanson says through an interpreter. \"I couldn't\nunderstand their voice. Friends, they didn't like that. Then the charge … it's way over their heads; the\nprice was too high for the TTY.\"\n\nAfter the video relay screen was installed, Johanson was able to call his sister for the first time since he\nwas incarcerated in 1976. He found out his father had passed away since the last time he had been in\ncontact with his family. Still, his sister was elated that he was able to call and could keep calling, free of\ncharge. \"My sister was glad when they were able to use that videophone, it's a lot of convenience,\" he\nsays. \"It's real good, we like that video phone better than the TTY. We're communicating better. I'm\nsaying the same thing when I'd type and have long words breaking up.\"\n\nSteward says wasn't always sure if his family understood him correctly over TTY, and vice versa. \"But\nnow with the video relay, it's natural,\" Steward says through an interpreter. \"Yeah. It's much clearer.\nNot as many errors with the communications, so you really much prefer it, so it's not as much time lost\nwith correcting what was said.\" He says it's also brought him closer to family members, who live several\n\n\n\n\"I have had to\ncommunicate with\nnumerous deaf people\nabout sexual assault or\nimpending death via a\nTTY, in English ‐‐ a\nlanguage that many of\nthem have never and\nnever will master.\"\n\nhours away and cannot afford to make frequent in-person visits. \"They've got a real person that they're\ntalking to, even if it's just a relayed person, you know,\" Steward says with a laugh. \"They actually hear a\nvoice.\"\n\nPrison Phone Companies and the FCC\n\nHandcuffs hang in the front office of the Rayburn Correctional Center. (Photo: Annie Flanagan)\n\nBack in 2013, the FCC was poised to make a preliminary but\nlandmark ruling on phone service in jails and prisons, a full 10\nyears after a petition was filed on behalf of low-income\nfamilies struggling to pay for phone calls with loved ones\nbehind bars. HEARD joined this coalition and asked the FCC\nto lower rates for deaf prisoners or replace aging TTY\nmachines with VRS altogether. Research shows\n(http://www.doc.state.mn.us/pages/files/large-\nfiles/Publications/11-11MNPrisonVisitationStudy.pdf) that\nkeeping prisoners in contact with friends and family on the\noutside can reduce recidivism. Plus, without interpreters or a\nmeaningful and affordable way to contact the outside world,\ndeaf people can get lost in the system\n(http://wtop.com/arlington/2015/03/deaf-immigrant-jailed-6-weeks-with-no-access-to-interpreter/),\nsometimes not even knowing why they are there.\n\n\"In no uncertain terms, lack of access to telecommunications has made it practically impossible for\ndeaf, deaf-blind, deaf-disabled and hard of hearing people, and many hearing individuals who rely on\nsign language to maintain contact with loved ones, communication with counsel to aid in their own\ndefense, and to maintain their sanity and safety,\" says Lewis, who recalled a deaf prisoner in Florida\n\n\n\n\n\nwho called her office \"to say his last goodbyes\" out of fear of violence. \"I have had to communicate with\nnumerous deaf people about sexual assault or impending death via a TTY, in English -- a language that\nmany of them have never and never will master. This is unfair to them and to me.\" The prisoner in\nFlorida still lives in fear at the same facility.\n\nHEARD submitted dozens of comments to the FCC, including handwritten letters from deaf prisoners\nwho reported trouble keeping in touch with family members, and described the painful isolation they\nwere experiencing. Some detailed grievances with prison staff had gone unresolved for years. In a\nnational survey conducted by HEARD, 35 percent of deaf prisoners reported that they did not have\naccess to a TTY machine. Another 27 percent had access \"sometimes,\" and only about 19 percent\nreported that the TTY machine in their facility was in \"good working condition.\"\n\nThe FCC agreed that it takes much longer to type out conversation over TTY than to speak over the\nphone, illegally subjecting a group of prisoners to price discrimination due to disability. The\ncommission estimated TTY calls take about four times as long to complete, and proposed capping the\nrate for TTY calls at 25 percent the per-minute rate that providers charge hearing prisoners. HEARD\nargued that estimate did not take into account the \"varying rates of literacy among deaf prisoners,\" but\nany rate decrease was better than nothing.\n\nThe prison phone industry disagreed. The prison phone company CenturyLink argued that, in its\nexperience, TTY calls only take about twice as long as voice calls. Securus, the leading prison phone\ncompany, claimed that the discount was \"not appropriate\" because TTY calls and voice calls \"incur the\nsame costs.\" The firms also opposed the FCC's proposal to lower the costs of prison phone calls in\ngeneral.\n\nAn outdoor chain link fence casts a shadow across Emmanuel Steward's hands. (Photo: Annie\nFlanagan)\n\n\n\n\"Deafness is a silent and\nnon‐obvious disability …\na typical prison guard\nmay think you can just\nwrite them notes.\"\n\nIn order to secure lucrative contacts in many states, prison phone companies are expected to pay \"site\ncommissions\" to the prisons themselves. Reformers refer to these payments as \"kickbacks,\"\n(https://nationinside.org/campaign/prison-phone-justice/facts/) and estimate that they generate\nabout an annual $152 million in revenue for prisons nationwide. The cost of these payments are passed\ndown to prisoners and their families in the form of add-on fees and higher rates, but the industry told\nthe FCC that site commissions are a cost business they should be compensated for.\n\nThose arguments didn't fly with the FCC, which had come under mounting pressure\n(http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/11690-flying-kites-to-the-fcc-demanding-fair-prison-phone-\ncall-rates) from activists and reformers. In 2013, the FCC issued interim caps on rates for all long-\ndistance, interstate calls to and from prisons, and in 2015 issued a final order reducing those caps by 50\npercent and setting caps on local and statewide calls for the first time. The FCC also banned certain\nadd-on fees and refused to consider \"site commissions\" as a cost to providers when setting the new\nrates, but the commission stopped short of banning these \"kickbacks\" altogether. Instead, the FCC\nencouraged prisons to do away with site commissions on their own, as some state systems already have.\n\nThe final ruling was supposed to cut the cost of prison phone calls in half, to about 11 cents per minute.\nBefore the ruling came down, rates in some states could potentially balloon to as high as $14 per\nminute, according to the FCC.\n\nPrison phone companies quickly lashed out\n(http://www.securustechnologies.com/about-us/press-\nreleases/-/asset_publisher/UtsVdgWJI3di/content/securus-\nrequests-that-federal-communications-commission-fcc-\nrefrain-from-issuing-misleading-statements-that-can-incite-\nviolence?\n\ninheritRedirect=false&redirect=http://www.securustechnologies.com/about-us/press-releases?\np_p_id=101_INSTANCE_UtsVdgWJI3di&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_col_id=column-\n1&p_p_col_pos=2&p_p_col_count=3) against the ruling. Securus CEO Richard Smith called it \"a\ncolossal error in judgment,\" and the industry took the FCC to court. In March, a federal judge issued a\npartial stay on the ruling, temporarily blocking the latest rate caps, but leaving the interim interstate\ncaps and several other portions in place, including reduced rates for TTY calls and other protections for\ndeaf and hard of hearing people in prison.\n\nThe FCC ruling also \"strongly\" encourages jails and prisons to install video relay systems for deaf\nprisoners, but stopped short of issuing the national mandate that HEARD had hoped for, leaving\nHuffman and civil rights attorneys to continue taking on jails and state prison offices one by one.\n\nElliot Minceberg, a consulting attorney with the Washington Lawyers Committee, which has filed a\nseries of lawsuits on behalf of deaf prisoners, says prisons are \"notoriously slow on technology and tech\nimprovement.\" Federal prisons, for example, have long opposed VRS due to supposed \"security\nconcerns,\" which always trump accommodations for prisoners. Plus, Minceburg says, prison bosses and\ntheir employees are often ignorant of deaf culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Deafness is a silent and non-obvious disability … a typical prison guard may think you can just write\nthem notes,\" says Minceberg, who agrees that it shouldn't take lawsuits to enforce federal law and\nensure that deaf prisoners have equal access to services. \"This is something that can and should be\ndone…. This shouldn't require litigation, but unfortunately it does.\"\n\nProfiting Off Deaf Prisoners?\n\nWilliam Johanson stands in a hallway at Rayburn Correctional Center, where he is serving a life\nsentence. (Photo: Annie Flanagan)\n\nWith the FCC's rate caps threatening revenue, prison phone companies have sought new revenue\nstreams with \"electronic messaging\" services and video chats. Reformers welcome new services for\nprisoners and their families, but say these options are expensive and highly restrictive compared to\nservices like email or Skype. Companies like Securus have even convinced some sheriff's departments\nto replace in-person visits (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-27/expensive-prison-\nskype-is-squeezing-out-in-person-visitation) with \"video visitation,\"\n(http://www.prisonpolicy.org/visitation/report.html) a shift that advocates ardently oppose. Lewis said\nthe companies could box out VRS as well.\n\nTL Lewis is well aware that prison phone companies are looking for new ways to make money. In fact,\ncompanies like Securus may now view VRS providers as competition in its emerging videophone\nmarket. In its comments to the FCC, Securus boasted about installing 5,000 videophones at US\nfacilities, but opposed HEARD's proposal to require VRS at jails and prisons, arguing that such\ntechnology is a privilege, not a right.\n\nVRS systems relay calls through an ASL interpreter; the video visitation and chat services offered by\nprison phone companies do not. VRS calls are also free, while the so-called \"prison Skype\" services are\nnot yet regulated by the FCC and can be costly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think they are just\nlooking for as many ways\nto pro�iteer from people\nwho are incarcerated. It's\na sick game they play.\"\n\nHowever, Lewis says prison phone companies are trying to convince jailers that the technologies are\none and the same, and their contracts require them to use the pay-to-play services instead of the\nfederally subsidized VRS.\n\n\"Phone companies are telling jails, prison and other facilities that these facilities cannot allow VRS\ninstallation based on these companies' exclusive phone contracts that, mind you, do not provide\naccessible telecommunications for the deaf,\" Lewis says. \"Now, we have to convince jails and prisons\nthat this is not the case -- if the contract does not provide accessible means for calling, federal disability\nrights law requires that the jail or prison go further.\"\n\nSeveral companies have told prison administrators that VRS\nvideophones are \"expensive,\" \"impossible\" and\n\"incompatible,\" among other excuses for why they cannot be\ninstalled, according to Lewis. \"It's difficult to find any other\nreason why prison telecom companies would posit any of this\nif not for ignorance and the possibility of cutting into their\nbottom line,\" Lewis says. \"Of course, it's not really cutting into\ntheir bottom line because countless deaf have gone for years\nwithout access rather than have their loved ones pay these exorbitant costs for ineffective\ncommunication in English.\"\n\nBack in Louisiana, it's been over a year since Huffman first contacted the Jefferson Parish Prison about\ninstalling VRS. Last October, a jail official told Huffman that Securus was already installing video\nvisitation technology, and the company had assured jail officials that it could integrate interpreter\nservices into that system, according to a series of emails shared with Truthout. Huffman explained that\nthis was impossible, because only a few companies are licensed to provide video relay services, and\nthese services are free, unlike whatever service Securus could offer. The conversation has gone nowhere\nsince.\n\nAttempts to reach a media representative and the government affairs office at Securus have been\nunsuccessful. The Jefferson Parish Sherriff's Office also failed to issue a response to my repeated\nrequests for information, including a copy of its contract with Securus.\n\n\"I think they are just looking for as many ways to profiteer from people who are incarcerated,\" Huffman\nsaid. \"It's a sick game they play.\" Huffman says there are at least two deaf people currently being held at\nJefferson Parish Prison, but the jail has done \"zero\" in terms of accommodation. \"They violate\neverything and seem to be invincible.\"\n\nIt's not easy to speak truth to power when power refuses to listen, but Huffman is committed to\nfinishing what he started when he decided to immerse himself in ASL and deaf culture in prison.\n\"Before I left, I promised those guys that I would do something, I would do whatever I could to improve\nthe system in its current state to something better,\" Huffman says.

With monopolistic contracts, these companies keep the costs of\nstaying in touch with an incarcerated loved one high.\n\nBut as expensive and arduous it is for inmates to lean on their families for support, deaf inmates have it far worse.\nIncarcerated deaf people require special technology to communicate with the outside world, and that technology is\noften too expensive, outdated or in disrepair.\n\nThe current requirement from the FCC is that prisons offer access to a \"TYY\" service. That's short for\nteletypewriters, clackity electronic keyboards first invented in the 1960's.\n\nSource: PAUL J. RICHARDS/Getty Images\n\nTo begin, these systems are often outdated, aging on storeroom shelves or broken without any guards or wardens\nwho know how to use them. A survey by a group called Helping Educate to Advance the Rights of the Deaf (HEARD)\nfound that only 19% of deaf inmates have access to TTY systems in \"good working condition.\"\n\nBut TTY's are also just outdated. The deaf community has largely moved on to video relay screens, or VRS, a\nsystem that allows deaf prisoners to sign on camera to an interpreter, who reads out the English to whoever you're\n\n1/3\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncalling.\n\n\"Many deaf people grow up using American Sign Language and their first language, and have to rigorously learn\nEnglish,\" Scott Huffman, an activist who does field work for HEARD, said. \"So their preferred mode of\ncommunication is sign language.\"\n\nInnocent families paying criminal charges\nMaking phone calls is already prohibitively expensive — at one point, only a few years ago, it could cost over a\ndollar a minute, even to people in county jails that hadn't been found guilty. For the 2.4 million people behind bars in\nthe U.S., a full third of their families are going into debt just to cover communication costs, and 87% of the people\npaying those costs are women (who are often raising children).\n\nIn order to bring those costs down, the FCC tried capping the rates to 11 cents a minute, but the prison telecoms\nsued until the FCC found a higher compromise.\n\nSource: Tri Vo, Jack Smith IV/Mic\n\nTo Talila Lewis, the founder and executive director of HEARD, the fear of more lawsuits is the leading theory for why\nthe FCC doesn't issue a broad demand that facilities update to the newer VRS systems. VRS could be seen as a\nthreatening product to video visitation, an expensive Skype-like video calling system that prison telecoms are selling\nas the new frontier of prison visits.\n\nPart of the struggle for Lewis to get attention to this problem is that nobody knows how big the problem is. The\nprison system has no idea how many of its inmates are deaf, or where its deaf inmates end up. HEARD keeps the\nonly database of deaf prisoners and their whereabouts, but can only track the deaf through tips from advocates and\ninmates. Lewis' lowest tenable estimate is 1% — or about 23,000 inmates among the nation's 2.3 million — but\n\n2/3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis suspects there may be many times that number.\n\nBecause jails still rely on teletype machines, these costs are far worse for deaf inmates. TTY calls take longer and\ncan be full of clerical errors.\n\n\"It takes a deaf person three times as long as other people to make those calls,\" Huffman said. \"So you have deaf\npeople paying $700, $800 a month just to talk to their husband or wife.\"\n\nOne jail at a time\nIn Lewis' ideal world, the FCC would raise the standards for accessibility in prisons for deaf inmates who, for\nexample, would have a hard time accessing sexual abuse hotlines and other services available to prisoners who can\nmore freely make calls to the outside world.\n\nThere are a slew of landmark laws that should protect deaf prisoners — the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 among them. Even FCC\nrepresentative Mark Wigfield acknowledged to Mic via email, \"the facilities themselves may be subject to\nrequirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\"\n\nA demonstration of the video relay screen in action.\nSource: Sorenson VRS\n\nSo Scott Huffman is putting heat on the jails one by one, educating wardens and local sheriffs about the importance\nof setting up video systems. And the jails and prisons are excited to install state-of-the-art VRS systems as soon as\nHuffman tells them one of the FCC's best-kept secrets: the systems are free.\n\nFor facilities that need modern video relay screens, the federal government will cover the costs of installation and all\nof the calls made. The prison telecoms might not appreciate the competition, but it would provide a necessary\nlifeline to disabled incarcerated people who need it.\n\n\"It's unconscionable that we haven't figured out to make sure that all systems are accessible, when we're asking for\nvideophones that cost nothing,\" Lewis said.\n\n3/3\n\n\n\n\tIncarcerated deaf people need a way to reach the outside world, but no one is listening\n\tInnocent families paying criminal charges\n\tOne jail at a time\n\n\n","text_data_10060550866324afe":"www.behearddc.org\nwww.behearddc.org\n[bookmark: GoBack][image: ]\n\nOctober 5, 2016 \n \nMarlene H.

We deny Securus’s Motion to Strike for reasons explained below.] \n\nBACKGROUND \nIn 2015, the Commission adopted the 2015 ICS Order, relying on its core authority over ICS rates to provide inmates and their families long-awaited relief from unfair, unjust, and unreasonable charges as part of its comprehensive reform of ICS.[footnoteRef:6]  The Commission’s approach included, inter alia: adopting tiered rate caps for both interstate and intrastate ICS calls; limiting and capping ancillary service charges; and establishing a periodic review of ICS reforms.[footnoteRef:7]  Notably, and most relevant to this Order, the Commission also declined to adopt a per-minute rate additive specifically to account for costs that facilities incur in connection with ICS.[footnoteRef:8]   [6:  See 2015 ICS Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 12769, para. 9; id. at 12822, para. 124 (noting the Commission was focusing on its “core ratemaking authority in reforming ICS . . . .”).]  [7:  See generally id. The 2015 ICS Order provides a detailed history of this proceeding through October 2015.  See id. at 12771-74, paras. 12-19.  We do not repeat this history here, but incorporate that description by reference.]  [8:  See Reconsideration Order at para. 7; see also 2015 ICS Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 12853, para. 139 (explaining that facilities’ legitimate ICS-related costs were “already built into our rate cap calculations and should not be recovered through an ‘additive’ to the ICS rates.”).  The Commission excluded site commission payments from the costs used to set the rate caps, but left it up to individual providers to decide whether, and, how much, to pay facilities in connection with ICS.  The only limitation was that providers’ rates had to comply with the applicable rate caps, regardless of whether they paid any site commissions.  See id. at 12827, para. 128.] \n\nFollowing the release of the 2015 ICS Order, four ICS providers filed petitions asking the Commission to stay various provisions of the Order.[footnoteRef:9]  On January 22, 2016, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) issued an order denying the stay petitions of GTL, Securus, and Telmate.[footnoteRef:10]  After the Bureau issued its order denying the stay petitions, the providers sought a stay from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit).  On March 7, 2016, the court stayed two provisions of the Commission’s ICS rules: 47 CFR § 64.6010 (setting caps on ICS calling rates that vary based on the size and type of facility being served) and 47 CFR § 64.6020(b)(2) (setting caps on charges and fees for single call services).[footnoteRef:11]  The D.C. Circuit’s March 7 Order denied motions for stay of the Commission’s ICS rules “in all other respects,”[footnoteRef:12] permitting the bulk of the Commission’s reforms to become effective.   On March 23, 2016, the D.C. Circuit modified the stay imposed in the March 7 Order to provide that “47 CFR § 64.6030 (imposing interim rate caps)” be stayed as applied to “intrastate calling services.”[footnoteRef:13]   [9:  See Petition of Global Tel*Link for Stay Pending Judicial Review, WC Docket No. 12-375 (filed Dec. 22, 2015), http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment/view?id=60001361606 (GTL 2015 Stay Petition); Securus Technologies, Inc.

In reaching these decisions, the Commission considered the record developed in response to the Hamden Petition and was not persuaded, in either case, of the necessity to reconsider the decisions made in the 2015 ICS Order. See Reconsideration Order at paras. 34-41.] \n\nIn granting Hamden’s request to expressly account for reasonable facility costs, the Commission carefully considered the record developed in response to the Hamden Petition, as well as the record in the underlying proceeding, and arguments presented in the litigation before the D.C. Circuit.[footnoteRef:21]  As a result of this review, the Commission increased the rate caps for debit and prepaid ICS calls to $0.31 per minute for jails with an average daily population (ADP) below 350, $0.21 per minute for jails with an ADP between 350 and 999, $0.19 per minute for jails with an ADP of 1,000 or more, $0.13 per minute for prisons.[footnoteRef:22]  It also increased the rate caps for collect calls by a commensurate amount.[footnoteRef:23]  The Commission found that the revised rate caps will “adequately ensure that rates for ICS consumers will be fair, just, and reasonable.”[footnoteRef:24]  The Reconsideration Order does not limit providers’ flexibility to decide whether to pay site commissions and, if so, how much to pay.[footnoteRef:25] [21:  See Reconsideration Order at para. 3.]  [22:  See id. at para. 12.]  [23:  See id.]  [24:  See id. at para. 13]  [25:  See id. at para. 38; id. at n. 151 (explaining that nothing in the Commission’s rules “restricts a provider’s ability to distribute as it chooses whatever revenue it collects . . . .”).] \n\nOn August 25, 2016, Securus filed a petition for stay of the Reconsideration Order.[footnoteRef:26]  Telmate, GTL, and the State Petitioners filed petitions shortly thereafter, on August 29, September 1, and September 2, 2016 respectively.[footnoteRef:27]  The Petitioners generally challenge the procedural soundness of the Reconsideration Order,[footnoteRef:28] the sufficiency of the revised rate caps,[footnoteRef:29] the Commission’s authority to set intrastate rate caps,[footnoteRef:30] and the Commission’s treatment of site commissions,[footnoteRef:31] among other things.  The Wright Petitioners, ICSolutions, and NCIC oppose the stay petitions, arguing that the Petitioners have failed to meet any of the requirements needed to justify a stay.[footnoteRef:32]  [26:  See Securus Stay Petition (seeking a stay of the new ICS rates). ]  [27:  See Telmate Stay Petition; GTL Stay Petition; State Petitioners Stay Petition. For purposes of this Order, we refer to Securus, Telmate, GTL, and the State Petitioners collectively, as “Petitioners.”]  [28:  See Telmate Stay Petition at 4-5; 15.]  [29:  See Securus Stay Petition at 4-6; Telmate Stay Petition at 13-14.]  [30:  See Telmate Stay Petition at 9-11; GTL Stay Petition at 11-15; State Petitioners Stay Petition at 5-7.]  [31:  See Securus Stay Petition at 7-10; Telmate Stay Petition at 12-13; GTL Stay Petition at 15-18.]  [32:  See generally Wright Opposition to Securus Petition; Wright Opposition to Telmate Petition; Wright Opposition to GTL Petition; Wright Opposition to States’ Petition; ICSolutions Opposition; NCIC Opposition. ] \n\nAs described below, we find that the Petitioners have failed to demonstrate that they will suffer irreparable harm if the Reconsideration Order is not stayed.  Nor have they persuaded us that they are likely to succeed on the merits or that a stay would be in the public interest.  To the contrary, we find that other parties—particularly ICS consumers—will be harmed if the Reconsideration Order is stayed.  Accordingly, we deny Petitioners’ requests. \nDiscussion \nTo qualify for the extraordinary remedy of a stay, a petitioner must show that: (1) it is likely to prevail on the merits; (2) it will suffer irreparable harm absent the grant of preliminary relief; (3) other parties will not be harmed if the stay is granted; and (4) the public interest would favor grant of the stay.[footnoteRef:33]  For the reasons described below, the Petitioners have failed to carry their burden of proving any of the relevant factors.   [33:  See Washington Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (Holiday Tours); Virginia Petroleum Jobbers Ass’n v. Federal Power Comm’n, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958) (VA Petroleum Jobbers).] \n\nPetitioners Are Unlikely to Prevail on the Merits\nPetitioners have failed to demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits.  As an initial matter, we note that Petitioners largely reiterate arguments they raised previously and which we disposed of in our order denying petitions seeking stays of the 2015 ICS Order.  We do not address those arguments again here, but instead rely on our previous analysis.[footnoteRef:34]  Moreover, despite the Petitioners’ claims to the contrary, the Reconsideration Order is procedurally sound; the Reconsideration Order does not dictate how providers spend their ICS revenues; the Commission relied on data from credible sources to determine facilities’ ICS-related costs; the revised rate caps allow providers to collect significantly more revenue than they could under the original rate caps; site commissions are clearly distinguishable from taxes and mandatory fees; and the Court’s previous stay orders are not determinative of the Petitioners’ likelihood of success in appealing the 2016 Reconsideration Order.  Accordingly, the Petitioners are unlikely to prevail on the merits of any of their claims.  [34:  See, e.g., Order Denying Stay Petitions, 31 FCC Rcd at 278-79, paras. 34-35 (addressing Telmate’s contention that it is not subject to section 201 because the service it provides is a one-way VoIP service); id. at 271-72, paras. 21-26 (explaining that it was reasonable for the Commission to use average costs as a basis for calculating the rate caps); id. at 279-281, paras. 36-39 (responding to arguments that section 276 is a “one-way ratchet” that only allows the Commission to establish a floor, but not a ceiling, on ICS rates); id. at 295-96, paras. 71-73 (explaining why continued reliance on the interim rate caps is insufficient to satisfy the Commission’s statutory obligations).] \n\nThe Reconsideration Order is Procedurally Sound \nTelmate contends that the Reconsideration Order is “procedurally defective.”[footnoteRef:35]  Specifically, Telmate argues Hamden did not explicitly request the actions the Commission took in the Order, rendering it “invalid.”[footnoteRef:36]  Telmate’s argument appears to be premised on the flawed notion that, in considering a petition for reconsideration, the Commission must either adopt the precise relief the petitioner has requested or deny the petition.  Not so.  Nothing in the Commission’s rules restricts it to such a binary choice.[footnoteRef:37]  Hamden’s Petition for Reconsideration requested that the Commission prohibit providers from paying site commissions, or, in the alternative, impose a “modest, per-minute facility cost recovery fee that would be added to the rate caps.”[footnoteRef:38]  As discussed above, the Commission considered Hamden’s request and other relevant evidence, and ultimately decided to amend the ICS rate caps to “better allow providers to cover costs facilities may incur that are reasonably related to the provision of ICS.”[footnoteRef:39]  The Commission did not prohibit site commissions;[footnoteRef:40] it also did not restrict payments by ICS providers to correctional facilities to a specific amount mandated by the Commission, as Hamden and others may have preferred.  The Commission’s action nevertheless responded to Hamden’s proposal that the Commission allow providers to collect additional revenue from consumers of ICS to ensure that rates for inmate calls are high enough to cover facility-incurred costs.[footnoteRef:41]  Furthermore, the Commission clearly had the discretion to modify its rates in response to the Hamden Petition, because the revised rates are a “logical outgrowth” of the Hamden Petition as well as the underlying rulemaking that resulted in the previous rates, and the Commission gave a reasoned explanation for its action that was supported by the record in the broader, ongoing inmate calling proceeding.   In any event, the Commission’s decision to consider the Hamden Petition but grant only part of the relief requested does not render the Commission’s order procedurally improper.  Thus, Telmate is unlikely to prevail on its claim that the Reconsideration Order is “procedurally defective.” [35:  See Telmate Stay Petition at 15. ]  [36:  See id. at 15 (arguing that the Commission “crafted a rule that no party . . . ‘presented’ or ‘requested,’ on reconsideration).  Securus raises a related concern, noting that that “[s]everal parties, including Mr. Hamden, wrote the Commission urging it not to take the proposed action.” Securus Stay Petition at 2.  ]  [37:  To the contrary, Section 405 of the Communications Act and the Commission’s associated rules explicitly afford the Commission the discretion to grant a petition for reconsideration “in whole or in part.”  47 U.S.C. § 405(a); see 47 CFR § 1.429(i).  The only requirement is that the Commission provide an explanation for its decision, which the Commission did in the Reconsideration Order.  Id. (requiring that an order on reconsideration contain “a concise statement of the reason” for the actions taken.).  ]  [38:  See Hamden Petition at ii. ]  [39:  Reconsideration Order, FCC 16-102, at para. 1. ]  [40:  Id. at paras. 22-30; id.at n. 54 (explaining the decision to not prohibit site commission payments). ]  [41:  See Wright Opposition to Telmate Petition at 6. ] \n\nThe Revised Rate Caps Better Allow ICS Providers to Recover their Costs of Providing ICS \nThe Petitioners generally argue that the FCC’s rate caps are impermissibly below providers’ costs.[footnoteRef:42]  To the extent that Petitioners reassert their opposition to the Commission’s decision to set rate caps in the 2015 ICS Order based on providers’ average costs, we note that the Bureau has already addressed these arguments, and do not address them here again here.[footnoteRef:43]  We do, however, address three versions of this argument that are relevant to the revised rate caps adopted in the Reconsideration Order, including arguments that the rate caps are too low because: (1) all of the increased revenue permitted under the revised rate caps will go to facilities; (2) the Commission never asked providers for data on ICS-related costs incurred by facilities; and (3) the revised rate caps add “mere pennies” to the 2015 rates.    [42:  See, e.g., Securus Stay Petition at 5-7; Telmate Stay Petition at 13-14.]  [43:  See Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions, 31 FCC Rcd 261, 271-73, paras. 21-24.] \n\nThe Reconsideration Order Does Not Dictate How Providers Spend Their ICS Revenues.  Securus and Telmate argue that “all” additional revenue from the rate cap increases adopted in the Reconsideration Order will go to facilities, not the providers.[footnoteRef:44]  These arguments ignore the plain language of the Reconsideration Order, which made clear that nothing in the Commission’s rules restricts a provider’s discretion to distribute or keep “whatever revenue it collects under the adopted rate caps.”[footnoteRef:45]  The Commission did not mandate that any – much less all – of the rate increases permitted under the revised caps must be shared with facilities.  Instead, the Commission continued to leave it to the parties to negotiate any payments to facilities.  Thus, if “all of the ‘new’ revenue under the 2016 rates” goes to facilities, as Telmate contends,[footnoteRef:46] that will be because a provider chose to make such payments as part of its negotiations with the facilities, and not because of any Commission action or requirement.   [44:  See Securus Stay Petition at 6 (arguing the “extra pennies that the Commission has doled out ‘for reasonable facility costs’ are not meant for ICS carriers.  ICS carriers will receive the same per-minute rates that were adopted last year”); Telmate Stay Petition at 14. ]  [45:  See Reconsideration Order, FCC 126-102, at para. 38, n. 151.]  [46:  Telmate Stay Petition at 14. ] \n\n The Commission Relied on Credible Data in Determining Facilities’ ICS-related Costs.  Telmate and Securus question the credibility of the data the Commission relied on in setting the revised rate caps.[footnoteRef:47]  Telmate asserts that the Commission’s analysis of providers’ ability to meet their costs under the revised rate caps is flawed, in part because providers did not report the portion, if any, of site commission payments that directly reimburse facilities for their ICS costs.[footnoteRef:48]  This argument ignores the fact that the Commission received data on the costs facilities incur in connection with ICS from multiple sources, including providers and – notably – the facilities themselves.[footnoteRef:49]  As the Commission explained, it took this information into account when it reconsidered its rate caps in order to “better reflect the costs that facilities incur that are reasonably related to the provision of ICS.”[footnoteRef:50]  Securus further disputes the Commission’s reliance on NSA’s proposal in setting the revised rate caps, arguing that the “NSA proposal was a good deal higher than what the FCC has adopted. . . .”[footnoteRef:51]  Securus’s argument relies on raw data from the NSA survey.[footnoteRef:52]  As the Commission noted in the Reconsideration Order, NSA itself reasonably elected to discount its raw survey data in estimating jails’ actual costs.[footnoteRef:53]  After explaining that NSA treated its survey data as “inputs” that it refined to generate more reliable estimates of facilities’ reasonable costs, the Commission found NSA’s ranges credible, particularly given that the NSA and Baker/Wood analyses arrived at similar conclusions.[footnoteRef:54]  Thus, contrary to Telmate and Securus’s assertions, the Commission reasonably relied on data from NSA and other credible sources to determine the costs that facilities may incur in connection with ICS. [47:  See id.at 13-14; see also Securus Stay Petition at 7 (claiming that the Commission does not have “any basis to predict that the earmarked rate increases will indeed ‘expressly account for reasonable facility costs related to ICS.’”).]  [48:  Telmate Stay Petition at 14 (arguing that “[p]roviders reported their costs to the FCC both with and without site commission payments, but they never reported costs that included only the portion of commission payments that directly reimburses facilities for their inmate calling costs.”). ]  [49:  See Reconsideration Order at para. 26 (explaining that the NSA Proposal is based on “the NSA’s cost survey, which gathered information on the costs to sheriffs of providing security and administrative functions necessary to allow ICS in jails, including the salaries and the benefits of the officers and employees performing the ICS-related duties.”). The Commission also analyzed data from other sources, most notably from Baker and Wood, in assessing the costs that facilities are likely to incur in connection with ICS.  See id.  (explaining that “the rate caps we adopt today are based on a hybrid of the Baker/Wood and NSA Proposals.”); see also id. at n. 106 (noting that the “Pay Tel Proposal . . . closely mirrors the rate increases we adopt in this Order.”).]  [50:  Id. at para. 22.  In fact, there was no reason to believe that providers “necessarily had access to the information needed to determine facility costs.”  Id.  at para. 24.]  [51:  Securus Stay Petition at 7. ]  [52:  See Letter from Mary J. Sisak, Attorney for National Sheriffs’ Association, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 12-375 (filed June 12, 2015) (NSA Proposal).]  [53:  Reconsideration Order at para. 29, n. 115 (citing the NSA proposal at 3-5).]  [54:  Id.] \n\nThe Revised Rate Caps Allow Providers to Collect Significant Additional Revenue.  Finally, Securus and Telmate argue that the revised rate caps remain too low and do not cover providers’ costs, despite the fact that the revised rate caps are higher than those adopted in the 2015 ICS Order.[footnoteRef:55]  Securus contends that “with respect to ICS providers, the FCC has simply re-adopted” the 2015 rate caps.”[footnoteRef:56]  These arguments are based on an apparent misreading of the Reconsideration Order.[footnoteRef:57]  The Reconsideration Order increased the 2015 rate caps by $0.02 per minute for prisons, by $0.05 per minute for larger jails, and by $0.09 per minute for the smallest jails.[footnoteRef:58]  These increases may be measured in “mere pennies” per minute, but they are substantial percentage increases over the previously adopted rate caps and add up to more than $150 million dollars per year in increased revenues for ICS providers.[footnoteRef:59]  Regardless of the way the increased revenue is allocated between providers and facilities, the revised rate caps allow for a substantial new pool of money for providers to recoup their costs.[footnoteRef:60]  To the extent Securus and Telmate are arguing that the rate cap increase must go to facilities, this is incorrect for the reasons previously stated.[footnoteRef:61]  The indisputable fact is that the revised rate caps adopted in the Reconsideration Order enable providers to generate more revenue than they could have under the rate caps adopted in the 2015 ICS Order.[footnoteRef:62]  Accordingly, claims that providers are no better off under the revised rate caps are baseless. [55:  See Securus Stay Petition at 4-7; Telmate Stay Petition at 13-14. ]  [56:  See Securus Stay Petition at 6; see also id. at 4 (“[T]he 2015 and 2016 rate[ caps] are, for all practical purposes, the same.”); Telmate Stay Petition at 13-14 (arguing that the “new rates—like the old rates—are well below the cost of providing approximately half of all calls in the industry, and are therefore unlawful.”).]  [57:  Additionally, as NCIC notes in its Opposition, Securus’s calculation of its average cost per minute (which it cites to demonstrate that its per-minute costs are greater than the revised rates) does not include ancillary fee revenue, which NCIC claims can amount to $0.03-$0.10 per minute using the Commission’s new ancillary fee structure.  NCIC Opposition at 3. ]  [58:  Reconsideration Order at para. 22.]  [59:  Indeed, the new rate cap for the smallest jails is over 40 percent higher than the previous cap, the rate caps for medium and larger jails increased by approximately 30 percent and even the rate caps for prisons increased by over 18 percent.   Compare Reconsideration Order, FCC 16-102, at para. 3 (listing the revised rate caps) with 2015 ICS Order, 30 FCC Rcd 12770, para. 9 (listing the rate caps for each tier).  An economic analysis by the Wright Petitioners shows that “the revised ICS rate caps eliminate any basis for ICS providers and correctional facilities to argue that any aspect of their costs to provide ICS . . . will not be reimbursed.”  Letter from Lee G. Petro, Counsel to Wright Petitioners, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 12-375, at 1 (filed July 29, 2016) (discussing the “enormous increase in revenue for ICS providers” produced by the rate cap increases adopted in the Reconsideration Order) (emphasis in original).]  [60:  In fact, the rates adopted in the Reconsideration Order “ensure that all providers can earn sufficient revenues to cover their ICS-related costs while also compensating facilities for reasonable costs incurred directly as a result of providing ICS.”  Reconsideration Order, FCC 16-102, at para. 4; see also id. n. 12 (explaining that “only one small provider may not be able to recover all of its ICS-related costs under the new rates.  That provider offered no explanation for its costs, which appear to be a significant outlier among our data set, and has not objected to our rate caps at any stage of this proceeding.”).]  [61:  See supra para. 13. ]  [62:  See supra n. 58. ] \n\nSite Commissions Are Negotiated Payments, Not Mandatory Taxes or Fees\nSeveral Petitioners raise various objections to the Commission’s treatment of site commissions.[footnoteRef:63]  Most of these objections are not new and were already addressed in the Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions and, therefore, are not addressed here.[footnoteRef:64]  Insofar as GTL now argues, however, that ICS providers should be allowed to recover site commission payments from consumers, in part because state and local governments often require site commission payments as “a condition precedent to a service arrangement between the facilities they govern and an ICS provider,”[footnoteRef:65] we address that contention below.   [63:  See GTL Stay Petition at 15-18; Securus Stay Petition at 7-10; Telmate Stay Petition at 12-13.]  [64:  See, e.g., GTL Stay Petition at 15-18 (arguing that the Commission’s refusal to allow ICS providers to recover site commissions is unlawful); Telmate Stay Petition at 12-15 (arguing that the Commission’s decision not to prohibit providers from paying site commissions, without including site commissions when setting the rate caps, is unlawful). The Commission addressed these arguments in the Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions, 31 FCC Rcd at 266- 273, paras. 14-26. ]  [65:  GTL Stay Petition at 16. ] \n\nWe are unpersuaded by GTL’s argument.  GTL attempts to equate site commissions with mandatory taxes and fees, which providers are permitted to pass through to consumers.[footnoteRef:66]  This is a false equivalency, however.  Taxes and regulatory fees are binding legal requirements that compel a class of entities to remit specified amounts to governmental bodies.[footnoteRef:67]  Site commissions, on the other hand, are not mandated by law, except in one state.[footnoteRef:68]  Rather, site commissions are an invention of the ICS industry,[footnoteRef:69] offered as an incentive to encourage facilities to enter a contract with a particular provider – usually the one willing to offer the highest payment.[footnoteRef:70]  These negotiated payments – originally initiated by the providers themselves – are clearly distinguishable from taxes and fees that are unilaterally imposed by a government body.[footnoteRef:71]  It is well established that “the obligation to pay taxes does not rest on any contract.”[footnoteRef:72]  Providers should not be able to pass the costs of site commissions – which some parties refer to as “kickbacks”[footnoteRef:73] – on to consumers, particularly given that ICS consumers generally have no alternative to the single ICS provider serving an inmate’s facility.[footnoteRef:74] [66:  The Commission has defined mandatory taxes and fees as fees that “a Provider is required to collect directly from consumers, and remit to federal, state, or local governments.”  A Mandatory Tax or Fee that is passed through to a Consumer may not include a markup, unless the markup is specifically authorized by “a federal, state, or local statute, rule, or regulation.”  Reconsideration Order, FCC 16-102, para. 31.]  [67:  Taxes are levied by state legislatures and are not subject to negotiation.  Even in the one state where the legislature has mandated site commissions, those payments cannot be properly categorized as “taxes,” because ICS providers remain free to negotiate the amount of their site commission payments, as long as the payments are above 40 percent of gross ICS revenue.  See Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 495.027(a)(2).  GTL’s reliance on cable franchise fees as evidence that the Commission must allow providers to pass the costs of site commissions through to consumers is also misplaced.  The Commission is subject to a statutory mandate to account for cable franchise fees in setting cable rates.  See City of Pasadena, et al, 16 FCC Rcd 18192, 18198, para. 14 (explaining that the rules related to cable franchise fees “have their origin in Section 623(b)(2)(C)(v) of the Communications Act, which provides that in establishing rate rules the Commission shall take into account ‘the reasonably and properly allocable portion of any amount assessed as a franchise fee . . .’”).  No similar statutory provision exists regarding site commission payments.  Even if the Commission’s treatment of cable franchise fees had not been dictated by statute, a decision to take such fees into account in regulating cable rates would not have required the Commission to allow providers of a different service (ICS) to pass through a different cost (site commission payments) to end users as part of its regulation of a totally different industry.  At most, the cable franchise fee precedent – absent the statutory mandate cited above – would have established that the Commission has the discretion to allow providers to pass site commission payments through to consumers, not that it had an obligation to do so. ]  [68:  See Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions, 31 FCC Rcd at 270, para. 19 (citing Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 495.027(a)(2) (West 2009) (prohibiting the corrections board from awarding a contract to an ICS vendor unless the provider pays a commission based on gross revenues received from the use of the services provided)). Although ICS providers are contractually obligated to pay site commissions in certain other states, those states do not have statutory provisions requiring the payment of site commissions.

For example, all carriers are subject to the same contribution rate for Universal Service and no carrier can negotiate a lower (or higher) contribution level.]  [72:  84 C.J.S. Taxation § 2 (2010).

[75:  See Securus Stay Petition at 10. ]  [76:  See id. at 7-10.] \n\nWith respect to Securus’s first argument, we have already addressed claims that site commissions should be included as costs under the rate caps,[footnoteRef:77] and note that the revised rate caps allow providers to collect significant additional revenue, which Securus could choose to put towards covering the costs of its existing Minimum Annual Guarantee payments.[footnoteRef:78]  Moreover, Securus likely has additional revenue from permissible ancillary fees that Securus did not include in its analysis,[footnoteRef:79] which may also offset some of the costs of covering the costs of fixed site commission payments.   [77:  See 2015 ICS Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 12821-1830; Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions, 31 FCC Rcd at 268-273, paras. 16-26.]  [78:  See supra para. 15. ]  [79:  See NCIC Opposition at 3; see also Wright Opposition to Telmate Petition at 5 (arguing that providers will be fairly compensated under the Commission’s rate caps and permissible ancillary fees). ] \n\nWith respect to Securus’s second argument, there is evidence in the record that Securus itself ignores the “reality” of the ICS market.  As Securus explains, in negotiating Minimum Annual Guarantees, it must contractually guarantee that a facility will receive a certain amount of money annually, regardless of the amount of revenue generated at that facility.[footnoteRef:80]  In other words, Securus has been entering into contracts with facilities for fixed payments even though it has known, or should have known, since at least 2012, that ICS rates, and thus ICS-derived revenues, could change at any time.[footnoteRef:81]  Securus claims that it has not been able to reduce or eliminate those terms,[footnoteRef:82] but this is simply a contractual dispute between the parties.  Securus also suggests that it may be unable to meet contractually binding Minimum Annual Guarantees.[footnoteRef:83]  Yet, evidence in the record suggests that Securus continues to offer substantial Minimum Annual Guarantees.[footnoteRef:84]  For example, just 14 days before Securus filed its Stay Petition, it submitted a response before the Georgia Department of Administrative Services defending the award of a contract in which Securus committed to make guaranteed payments of $19.6 million over four years.[footnoteRef:85]  Given that Securus’s obligations to pay Minimum Annual Guarantees appear to be a “problem” of its own making, it is unlikely to prevail on claims that such guaranteed payments support a stay of the Commission’s revised rate caps.

Thus, any claims that our actions today upset ‘investment-back expectations of ICS providers’ are likely to fail, particularly claims from providers that recently entered into new contracts with high site commissions. . .”).]  [82:  Securus Stay Petition at 9.

See ICSolutions Opposition at 6 (explaining that “[n]ine days before the implementation date, Securus renegotiated all of their contracts to exclude site commissions as a result of the 2013 Order.”). ]  [83:  Securus Stay Petition at 9-10.]  [84:  See ICSolutions Opposition at 7. ]  [85:  Wright Opposition to Securus Petition at 6 (describing Securus’ bid and noting that if Securus was “truly concerned about the impact of MAGs on its bottom line, it could have simply walked away from its offer during the Georgia proceedings”).] \n\nThe Court’s Previous Stay Orders Are Not Determinative of the Petitioners’ Likelihood of Success \nPetitioners argue that the D.C. Circuit’s previous actions signal that it is likely to stay the 2016 ICS Reconsideration.[footnoteRef:86]  The State Petitioners even go as far as to claim that the court has expressed “grave reservations” about aspects of the Commission’s 2015 ICS Order, and argue that if the Commission does not stay the Reconsideration Order, it will “cast disrespect on both the federal courts and on the States as sovereigns.”[footnoteRef:87]  Petitioners are correct that the D.C. Circuit stayed three provisions of the Commission’s 2015 ICS rules in two separate orders.[footnoteRef:88]  Contrary to Petitioners’ arguments, however, the Court provided no comment or explanation “to suggest the rationale behind the stay of the rates in the 2015 Order.”[footnoteRef:89]  Moreover, the Court declined to stay any other portion of the Commission’s ICS reforms.[footnoteRef:90]  Thus, as the Wright Petitioners aptly explain, it is “impossible to accurately determine why the Court of Appeals granted a stay.”[footnoteRef:91]  Petitioners’ prior success in obtaining a stay of a different, but related, order does not mean they are likely to succeed on the merits of the arguments presented in the newest stay petitions.  The Petitioners previously complained that the rate caps were too low to cover their costs, and that the Commission acted unreasonably when it recognized the possibility that facilities incur legitimate costs in providing access to ICS but then declined to separately account for such costs when calculating the rate caps.[footnoteRef:92]  Those may have been the arguments that moved the Court of Appeals to grant a stay, but they lack force against the Reconsideration Order.[footnoteRef:93]   [86:  See State Petitioners Stay Petition at 4-5; GTL Stay Petition at 21 (arguing that the rates adopted in the Reconsideration Order will be invalidated, as “the D.C. Circuit’s stay orders suggest is likely.”); Securus Stay Petition at 4 (arguing that Petitioners’ previous challenges were “well received by the D.C. Circuit . . . and the Order on Reconsideration has very low chances of survival); Telmate Stay Petition at 9. ]  [87:  State Petitioners Stay Petition at 4-5. ]  [88:  See supra para. 3.  ]  [89:  ICSolutions Opposition at 3; see also Wright Opposition to States’ Petition at 3. ]  [90:  See, e.g., Wright Opposition to Telmate Petition at 3 (arguing that the fact that the court allowed the caps on ancillary fees to go into effect for both inter- and intra-state calling suggests that the court did not believe the appellants were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that section 276 does not give the Commission sufficient authority to regulate rates for intrastate ICS.); ICSolutions Opposition at 3 (arguing that “Securus grasps at straws when it suggests that the Court’s stay of the rates in the 2015 [ICS] Order” indicates that Securus is likely to prevail in appealing the Reconsideration Order.)]  [91:  Wright Opposition to GTL Petition at 2 (noting that the standard applied by the Court requires a balancing test of four factors and parties cannot know why the Court acted as it did “without being provided further information from the Court of Appeals.”). ]  [92:  See, e.g., GTL 2015 Stay Petition at 9-13; Telmate 2015 Stay Petition at 9-10. ]  [93:  See Order on Reconsideration at para. 13 (increasing the rate caps substantially and expressly accounting for reasonable facility costs), ] \n\nPetitioners Will Not Suffer Irreparable Injury Absent a Stay \nThe Petitioners have failed to prove that they will suffer irreparable injury absent a grant of their stay petitions.  Many of the Petitioners’ arguments were already addressed in the Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions and, therefore, are not addressed here.[footnoteRef:94]  We reject Petitioners’ additional claims of irreparable harm for the reasons described below.  [94:  See Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions, 31 FCC Rcd at 290-295, paras. 60-69. ] \n\nPetitioners Failed to Carry Their Burden of Proving Irreparable Harm.  The Petitioners all claim that they will suffer irreparable harm if the Reconsideration Order is not stayed.[footnoteRef:95]  None of them have carried their burden of proving they will suffer irreparable injury, however.  [95:  See Securus Stay Petition at 11; Telmate Stay Petition at 6; GTL Stay Petition at 21; State Petitioners Stay Petition at 7.] \n\nFirst, unspecific and unsupported claims of potential lost revenue do not constitute irreparable harm.[footnoteRef:96]  Here, Securus and Telmate each offer conclusory affidavits from executives of their respective companies stating that they will experience unrecoverable revenue losses if the Reconsideration Order takes effect.[footnoteRef:97]  Their affidavits, however, provide no analysis or supporting evidence of their costs to support their arguments that they will not be fairly compensated.[footnoteRef:98]  GTL and the State Petitioners’ arguments are even less convincing.[footnoteRef:99]  Neither GTL nor the State Petitioners provide affidavits, or any details about the extent of the harm that they expect to face.  Instead, they offer only generalized statements that amount to nothing more than speculation.[footnoteRef:100]  Without providing access to the Petitioners’ underlying calculations or an explanation of their analysis, Petitioners fail to demonstrate that their alleged injury is “certain” or “great.”   [96:  See, e.g., Wisc. Gas, 758 F.2d at 674 (to demonstrate irreparable harm “the injury must be both certain and great”). ]  [97:  See Securus Stay Petition at 11; Telmate Stay Petition at 6.]  [98:  See Wright Opposition to Telmate Petition at 4.  For example, Telmate argues that it will lose revenue absent a stay, but does not argue that the loss in revenue will cause Telmate to operate at a loss.  See Telmate Stay Petition at 7.  The magnitude of Telmate’s harm is thus neither “certain” nor “great” enough to justify a stay.  See supra n.[95 (citing Wisc. Gas, 758 F.2d at 674).  We also note that Securus did not seek to stay the 2015 rate caps, which were lower than the ones adopted in the Reconsideration Order.  See generally Securus Technologies, Inc. Petition for Partial Stay of Second Report and Order Pending Appeal (FCC 15-136), WC Docket No. 12-375 (filed Dec. 22, 2015), http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment/view?id=60001361748.  ]  [99:  See GTL Stay Petition at 21; State Petitioners Stay Petition at 7.]  [100:  See Wright Opposition to GTL Petition at 7 (“GTL’s Petition also failed to include any analysis to support its claim that it will suffer irreparable injury as the result of the new ICS rate caps. Unlike Securus and Telmate, GTL apparently could not be bothered to even submit a self-serving affidavit from one of its executives to make the argument that GTL has lost $X million in renegotiating its monopoly contracts.”). ] \n\nSecond, even if the Petitioners had submitted specific and supported claims proving they will face revenue losses as a result of the Reconsideration Order, the harms they allege do not constitute irreparable harm.  The Petitioners essentially argue that because the Reconsideration Order did not adopt the relief they would have preferred, they will suffer irreparable harm.[footnoteRef:101]  Moreover, as the Wright Petitioners point out, the Petitioners attempt to stay an order curbing excessive ICS rates by pointing to the decrease in their excessive ICS profits as their justification for the stay.[footnoteRef:102]  These arguments are insufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm.  The Commission is tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that ICS rates are fair, just, and reasonable.[footnoteRef:103]  The actions necessary to accomplish this, as ICSolutions notes, will rarely “satisfy all interested participants.” [footnoteRef:104]  However, a potential loss of revenue alone does not entitle a party to a stay of a regulation, particularly when the regulation in question is aimed at curbing the party’s excessive rates.[footnoteRef:105]   [101:  See ICSolutions Oppositions at 8. ]  [102:  See Wright Opposition to Securus Petition at 5. ]  [103:  See 47 U.S.C. §§ 201, 276.]  [104:  See ICSolutions Opposition at 8.]  [105:  See Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (explaining that it is “well settled that economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm”; to demonstrate irreparable harm “the injury must be both certain and great”); Holiday Tours, 559 F.2d at 843 n.2 (holding that “‘mere’ economic injuries” are not sufficient for a stay). See also Wright Opposition to Telmate Petition at 7; ICSolutions Opposition at 8.  Moreover, it is unclear whether any of the Petitioners’ “analyses” took into account the increased demand that is likely to result from lower rates.  See, e.g., Telmate Mar. 25, 2013 Comments at 12 (“Telmate’s experience proves the . . . economic truism that lower prices stimulate demand . . . [w]hen there are lower rates . . .  volume goes up and everyone wins.”); Wright Opposition to Telmate Petition at 5 (discussing “undisputed evidence that call volume increases when rates are lowered.”).  Nor do any of the Petitioners even mention their continuing revenue streams from various ancillary services and fees.  ] \n\nProviders Entered Into Contracts Willingly.  Securus, Telmate, and GTL also argue that the revised rate caps adopted in the Reconsideration Order will require them to renegotiate their contracts with facilities, and claim that various costs associated with this process will cause irreparable harm.[footnoteRef:106]  We reject these claims for the reasons explained below.    [106:  See Securus Stay Petition at 11-12; Telmate Stay Petition at 6; GTL Stay Petition at 22. ] \n\nSecurus, Telmate, and GTL argue that renegotiating contracts will cause them to incur unreimbursable compliance costs, loss of goodwill, and “deal fatigue.”[footnoteRef:107]  Similar to Petitioners’ claims of lost revenues, discussed above, Securus, Telmate, and GTL’s arguments that renegotiating contracts will lead to compliance and negotiation costs are neither specific enough nor sufficiently supported to justify a claim of irreparable harm.[footnoteRef:108]  These claims are speculative, at best, and are the type of ‘“blanket, unsubstantiated allegations of harm’ that may not be used to grant a stay.”[footnoteRef:109]  We also note that providers willingly entered into their contracts with facilities, with the knowledge that the Commission was undertaking comprehensive ICS reform and that regulations could change, in ways that might affect those contracts.[footnoteRef:110]   [107:  For example, Telmate states that without a stay, it will incur compliance costs, including “performing tasks such as negotiating amendments to all of its contracts, traveling to meet with customers to explain the changes, and altering its billing and internal systems.”  Telmate Stay Petition at 7.  Securus and GTL further allege that renegotiating contracts will cause the loss of customer goodwill arising from the ‘deal fatigue’ of having to re-negotiate contracts twice in less than a year.  Securus Stay Petition at 12; GTL Stay Petition at 22.  ]  [108:  See supra n. 104; Holiday Tours, 559 F.2d at 843 n.2 (referring to a “severe” injury as “destruction of a business”).]  [109:  Am. Meat Inst. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 968 F. Supp. 2d 38, 77 (D.D.C. 2013) (subsequent history omitted).]  [110:  See supra para. 20. In addition, providers were not required to renegotiate their contracts after the 2015 rate caps were stayed.  Any contracts that complied with the 2015 rate caps would also comply with the revised regulations adopted in the Reconsideration Order.  If providers were truly concerned about the “harms” of renegotiating such contracts, they could have waited for the final disposition of all of the ICS-related appeals before approaching their customers again.] \n\nGranting the Requested Stays Would Result in Harm to Third Parties \nThe Petitioners argue that third parties will not be harmed if the Commission grants their stay petitions because those parties will be protected by the interim rate caps currently in effect.  We reject these claims, however, and find that staying the Reconsideration Order would harm third parties, including inmates and their families, who rely on ICS to communicate with each other.[footnoteRef:111]  Although the interim rate caps adopted in the 2013 ICS Order ameliorated some of the harm caused by unfair, unjust, and unreasonable ICS calling rates, those interim caps apply only to interstate traffic.  This severely limits the scope of the relief, because over 80 percent of ICS calls are intrastate.[footnoteRef:112]  Moreover, the interim rate caps are still higher than the rate caps for most tiers, even after the Commission’s decision to increase those rate caps in the Reconsideration Order.[footnoteRef:113]  Thus, many consumers are paying rates above what the Commission has found to be fair, just, and reasonable even for those calls that are currently subject to the interim rate caps.[footnoteRef:114]   [111:  See Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions, 31 FCC Rcd 261, 295, at para. 72 (noting that a stay of the Commission’s rate caps would delay relief to millions of ICS customers).]  [112:  Id. at para. 71 (citing 2015 ICS Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 12768, para. 7).]  [113:  See Reconsideration Order at n. 2 (explaining that the weighted average for all calls under the revised rate caps were “well below” the interim rate caps currently in effect).]  [114:  GTL further contends that third parties will not be harmed if the Commission grants GTL’s Petition because the interim rate caps are similar to the rate caps the Wright Petitioners requested in their original filing over a decade ago.  GTL Stay Petition at 23.  We addressed those arguments in the Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions and incorporate that response by reference.  See Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions, 31 FCC Rcd 261, 295, at para. 72 (noting that “[t]elecommunications costs have fallen . . .  and ICS rates that might have been fair, just, and reasonable in 2002 [when the Wright Petitioners filed their original request] may be excessive now.”).     ] \n\nThe Public Interest Does Not Support a Grant\nThe Petitioners have failed to prove that the public interest supports grants of their stay petitions. We reject their arguments for the reasons described below.\nThe Adopted Rate Caps Serve the Public Interest.  Petitioners’ contentions that a stay will benefit the public interest contradict evidence in the record of the urgent need to reform the ICS market.[footnoteRef:115]  Staying the reforms adopted in the Reconsideration Order would delay relief to inmates, their families, and loved ones, who depend on ICS to maintain contact and who would continue to be harmed by excessive ICS rates.  As noted, the interim rates currently in effect do not apply to intrastate calls.  Thus, without the reforms adopted in the Reconsideration Order, intrastate rates in most states will remain at egregiously high levels in most of the country.[footnoteRef:116]  Accordingly, we agree with the Wright Petitioners that there will be “overwhelmingly positive public interest benefits arising from” implementation of the Reconsideration Order and “[a]ny delay …would be, in fact, counter to the public interest.”[footnoteRef:117] [115:  See id. at 297, para. 78 (citing 2015 ICS Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 12768, para. 7).]  [116:  See 2015 ICS Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 12768, para. 7.  In addition, as ICSolutions points out, “[t]he failure of the market to effectively control rates is hindering competition. Whenever one charge is controlled, the industry finds another charge to manipulate, forcing all providers to choose between fair, just, and reasonable rates or charging exorbitant rates.” ICSolutions Opposition at 10.]  [117:  Wright Opposition to Securus Petition at 8. ] \n\nThe Public Interest Extends Beyond the Conservation of Judicial Resources.  Securus and Telmate argue that the public interest is served by the conservation of judicial resources.[footnoteRef:118]  While conserving judicial resources is an important public interest consideration, so too is ensuring that consumers have access to fair, just, and reasonable rates under sections 201 and 276 of Communications Act.  Moreover, the latter involves statutory mandates that the Commission is charged with enforcing.[footnoteRef:119]  If the Reconsideration Order is stayed, intrastate rates, in particular, will be unfairly high.[footnoteRef:120]  As the Wright Petitioners point out, “[a]ny delay in the effectiveness of the Recon Order would delay immediate relief to millions of ICS customers currently being charged excessive ICS intrastate rates, who have seen their ICS expenses increase due to the actions of Telmate and other ICS providers.”[footnoteRef:121]  Thus, while we agree that judicial resources are a public interest concern, the record before us demonstrates that the public interest would be served best by capping ICS rates at fair, just, and reasonable levels without delay.[footnoteRef:122]  [118:  See Securus Stay Petition at 13; Telmate Stay Petition at 8 (contending the FCC should “preserve the D.C. Circuit’s (and the parties’) resources” because in the absence of an administrative stay, “the parties will proceed to the D.C. Circuit”). ]  [119:  See 47 U.S.C. §§ 201, 276.]  [120:  See supra para. 28; see also Order Denying 2015 Stay Petitions, 31 FCC Rcd at 295, para. 71 (citing 2015 ICS Order, 30 FCC Rcd at 12775, para. 21).]  [121:  Wright Opposition to Telmate Petition at 8. ]  [122:    See ICSolutions Opposition at 3 (explaining that Securus’s argument is “baseless” and pointing out that “it is axiomatic that it would save resources for the Court and all parties to consider the merits of the [Reconsideration Order] in the [context of] the current Appeal [of the 2015 ICS Order].”)  ] \n\nSecurus’s motion to strike\nSecurus has filed a motion to strike those parts of NCIC’s Opposition that address Securus’s Stay Petition.[footnoteRef:123]  In support of its motion, Securus points out that NCIC’s Opposition was filed “out of time.”[footnoteRef:124]  While Securus is correct that NCIC filed its Opposition after the deadline for oppositions had passed, we note that this proceeding has been designated “permit but disclose,” meaning that parties are permitted to submit ex parte presentations into the record.[footnoteRef:125]  We find that treating NCIC’s late-filed Opposition as a permissible ex parte filing would “best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to the ends of justice.”[footnoteRef:126]  In making this finding, we recognize that NCIC’s Opposition is not limited to Securus’s Stay Petition.  Rather, NCIC’s filing is explicitly directed at all four stay petitions.[footnoteRef:127]  [123:  See Motion to Strike at 1.]  [124:  Id. (explaining that NCIC’s response to the Securus Petition was due September 6, 2016, but the NCIC Opposition “was not filed until September 14.”).  Securus also notes that NCIC never requested the confidential version of the Securus Stay Petition.  Id.]  [125:  See Rates for Interstate Inmate Calling Services, Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 29 FCC Rcd 13170, 13233, para. 161 (2014); 47 CFR §§ 1.1200 et seq.]  [126:  47 U.S.C. 154(j).]  [127:   NCIC Opposition at 1.] \n\nWe agree with Securus that it would have been better for NCIC to acknowledge that its filing was “out of time” and provide an explanation for its untimely filing.[footnoteRef:128]  We also recognize, however, that NCIC could have entered its arguments into the record without any dispute if it had simply styled its submission as an ex parte filing rather than an Opposition.  In this particular instance, we find that “the ends of justice” would not be served by letting form trump substance.  In reaching this decision, we consider the fact that Securus had sufficient time to file a substantive response to NCIC’s filing, had it chosen to do so.[footnoteRef:129]  We also consider the benefit of having as fulsome a record as possible regarding the issues raised in the stay petitions, particularly given the relatively small number of parties that weighed in on either side of the issue.  Finally, we note that Securus is not prejudiced by our decision not to strike NCIC’s Opposition, because even if we were to grant the Motion to Strike, we still would deny all of the stay petitions, including the one filed by Securus.[footnoteRef:130]  We therefore deny Securus’s Motion to Strike.   [128:  Motion to Strike at 1.]  [129:  Securus had sufficient time to draft and file a Motion to Strike.]  [130:  Put another way, our decision to deny the petitions does not depend on any arguments or facts that were presented solely in the NCIC Opposition.  ] \n\nOrdering clauses \nAccordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to the authority contained in sections 1, 4(i), 4(j), 201, 225, 276, and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§ 151, 154(i)-(j), 201, 225, 276, and 303(r) and the authority delegated pursuant to section 0.91 and 0.291 of the Commission’s rules, 47 CFR §§ 0.91 and 0.291, this Order Denying Stay Petitions in WC Docket No. 12-375 IS ADOPTED.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED, that the Securus Technologies, Inc.

(“Securus”), through counsel and pursuant to 47 C.F.R. \n\n§§ 1.3 and 1.45, moves the Commission to strike the Opposition to Petitions for Stay filed out of \n\ntime by Network Communications International Corp. (“NCIC”) with regard to any statements \n\nor arguments directed to the Securus Petition for Partial Stay of Order on Reconsideration \n\nPending Appeal (FCC 16-102) (“Securus Petition”). \n\nThe Securus Petition was filed and posted on August 25, 2016.  Commission Rule 1.45 \n\nstates that Oppositions to any motion, petition, or request, which includes a petition for stay, are \n\ndue “within 10 days after the original pleading is filed.”  47 C.F.R. § 1.45(b).  NCIC’s response \n\ntherefore was due September 6, 2016, but it was not filed until September 14. \n\nNCIC does not even acknowledge that its Opposition is being filed out of time, and thus \n\ndoes not provide any grounds on which its lateness could be excused.  Timeliness is particularly \n\nimportant here, because Securus has requested that its Petition for Stay be resolved by September \n\n20, 2016 – in six days – due to the tremendous amount of work that must be done to implement \n\nthe new rate caps adopted in the Order on Reconsideration. \n\nSecurus also notes that NCIC never requested the Confidential Version of the Securus \n\nPetition, and thus has little basis to address Securus’s showing of significant, irreparable harm. \n\n\n\n2 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor these reasons, the Commission should grant this Motion and strike the NCIC \n\nOpposition as it relates to the Securus Petition for Partial Stay of Order on Reconsideration \n\nPending Appeal (FCC 16-102). \n\nBy: /s/Andrew D.
